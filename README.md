# Responsive nav menu

## The idea here was to build a simple yet responsive header. On click, the menu
## is displayed. I used google fonts, icoFont for the hamburger bar and jQuery.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run start` - Starts the development server
- `npm run deploy` - Deploys the project to your GitHub Pages
- `npm run build` - Build the project locally
